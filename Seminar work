What shall we do with the drunken sailor
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
Early in the morning?

Shave his belly with a rusty razor!
Put him in a long boat till his sober!
Stick him in a scupper with a hosepipe bottom!
Put him in the bed with the captains daughter!
Early in the morning!
